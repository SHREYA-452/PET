						<p id = "pp">How do I apply to adopt a pet?</p>
						<p id = "pp">First, please read our adoption process page for a step-by-step guide. Each animal will have instructions on its online adoption listing on how to apply to adopt.</p>
						<p id = "pp">What can I expect in the adoption process?</p>
						<p id = "pp">We welcome all adopters! Our goal is to make the best match we can between our adopters and our shelter pets. We do this by providing all information that we know about each animal and letting the adopter decide if the pet is a match for them. We want to be a lifelong resource for you and your pets!</p>
						<p id = "pp">How long does the adoption process take?</p>
						<p id = "pp">The length of time that an adoption takes varies widely by type of pet, the number of meet-and-greets required, whether the pet is in the shelter or in foster care, and the availability of open appointments. Most shelter pets receive multiple applications, and we recommend that you explore other available shelter pets if you have not heard back within 72 hours.</p>
						<p id = "pp">I have other pets. Is that okay?</p>
						<p id = "pp">Yes! We want to make sure that the animal you're interested in adopting would be compatible with any current pets in the household. Dogs, rabbits, and guinea pigs may require a same species meet up.</p>
						<p id = "pp">How much does it cost to adopt?</p>
						<p id = "pp">Review our adoption fees for the cost of adoption. Adopters of dogs, cats, miniature goats and potbellied pigs who live in Seattle or King County must also purchase a two-year altered pet license at the time of adoption.</p>
